# cross-browser-url-launcher
Need to quickly test a URL (or site) in **ALL THE BROWSERS**? This repository is for you. 

Windows-only (batch file) for now, but other scripting languages and operating systems to follow. Also in the pipeline is the ability to launch more than one URL from a single command.
